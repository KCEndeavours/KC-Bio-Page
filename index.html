        <p>Hello, friendly neighbourhood coder here. I grew up with a fascination of computers and the virtual world, leading to me 
            taking this Web Developent course. I one day hope to create an app that can be used to fascilate the learning of 
            Accounting for students, including the various statements and reports associated with it, and a webpage that can be used
            to display my works and serve as a hub for clients to get into contact with me.</p>
